    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>"This was just like my mom used to make. It was good and basic. An iron skillet is really a must. I didn't really change anything. In the end, I drained off most of the oil and made cream gravy with the drippings. Great over rice. I also looked at the Deep South Fried Chicken Recipe. They are very similar and combined the instructions for both recipes. If you have not made fried chicken before I would recommend you look at the Deep South recipe as it has a lot of really great tips."</p>
